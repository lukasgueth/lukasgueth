### Hi I'm Lukas, 👋

a 20 years-old Computer Science undergraduate student. I'm currently obsessed with TypeScript and NodeJS.

I'm fascinated by Computer Science and programming because it enables (nearly) endless possibilites.

# What I currently do:  
- 🎓 Studying Computer Science at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms University Bonn.
- 👨🏽‍🏫 Tutoring at cleverly (Computer Science and Maths)

# The code I write (some programming skills):  
- TypeScript/NodeJS/JS (main language)
- Learned Java while programming StarKI [StarKIRepo] + at University
- Started with PHP as a real programming language
- Sadly had to learn Delphi at school
- Worked quite a lot with the Angular Framework

# Computer Science goals: 
- 🤖 Study AI technologies
- 📊 Study ML with python and R

# Programming goals: 
- 🐍 Learn more python
